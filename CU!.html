	<h2>Synopsis</h2>

	<p> Cheer Up! follows the lives of five high schoolers as they deal with a competitive high school. Students with the lower ranks are treated terribly while the students with the highest ranks are treated like royalty. Complete with overbearing parents and a corrupt school leadership, students with the lowest ranks form a dance club to cope. Right next to this dance club is a club filled with the highest ranked students. Kim Yeol, the highest ranked student, and Yeon Doo, leader of the dance club, are immediately at odds due to their school's treatment. The drama continues as students learn to see past competitions and parental pressures to realize that friendship is more important than rank. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 10/10</h2>
	<p> This is one of my favorite dramas! There was a perfect balance between friendship, romance, and betrayal. The adults will want to make you rip your hair out but the kids will keep you at the edge of your seat. There are amazing character developments throughout the drama, added to a plot that will make sure you're never bored. I 100% recommend watching it. </p>
