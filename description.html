	<p> Toucans are usually short and have thick necks. They have a large bill that has serrated edges which allow them to catch their food. The bill is usually very bright and attention catching. This may serve multiple purposes: it might attract mates, scare away predators, and help the toucan reach food that is far away from them. The bright colors also provide camouflage in the light of a rainforest canopy. They also have narrow, feather-like tongues. A toucan's size and color depends on which species it is. There are about 40 different types of toucans. </p>
