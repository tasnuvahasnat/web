	<h2>Synopsis</h2>

	<p> Bei Er Duo is a struggling voice actress with plans to study in Japan. Ye Shu Wei is a famous violinist. Er Duo and Shu Wei get roped into a reality show where they have to pretend to be a couple. Forcing these two together results in a wonderfully spontaneous love. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 6/10</h2>
	<p> This drama had a lot of awkward situations that made me laugh and get a strong sense of secondhand embarrassment. Ye Shu Wei is a very reserved guy while Bei Er Duo is more outgoing. There weren't many surprises while watching, I would definitely say that this was more of a simple storyline. The second leads also had an interesting relationship with each other. While the couples were cute, the storyline felt a bit bland and slow at times. Overall, I would recommend watching this if you enjoy simple love stories. </p>
