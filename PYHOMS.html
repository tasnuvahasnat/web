	<p> Si Tu Mo is a college student who doesn't have a path for her future. She ends up living with Gu Wei Yi, a physics student who knows exactly what he wants for his future. Gu Wei Yi helps her find her path in life as they fall in love and deal with various obstacles. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 8/10</h2>
	<p>I really enjoyed watching this drama and each couple pairing had a very sweet dynamic. The overall plot was pretty realistic as Si Tu Mo and Gu Wei Yi had to cope with overbearing parents, a long-distance relationship, and financial hurdles. There were a few love triangles that were resolved peacefully and it had a very happy ending. The reason I would dock it a few points is because the drama did have a couple moments where the plot seemed a bit uninteresting. Overall, it was very sweet and I would definitely recommend watching it. </p>
