<h3>How it Works</h3>
	<p>When the player clicks "run," the file loads a welcome message that allows the player to create a name for their character and empire using <i>input</i>. After this, the file loads a menu containing options like "military menu," "province management," "graphs," and the option to access their annual dilemma. The military menu and province management uses <i>global</i> variables and <i>input</i> to generate options. The graphs are created using <i>lists</i> that keep track of changes in status and <i>matplotlib</i>. The annual dilemma is generated using <i>random</i> to access a <i>dictionary</i> of 26 events and 52 possible outcomes. The player inputs either a 0 or 1 to give their response. If the response is not a 0 or 1, it results in an IndexError and the player will have to restart the game. In addition to this, each turn a map of the empire and surrounding areas is generated using <i>turtles</i> and colors. [insert new turtle functions] </p>
