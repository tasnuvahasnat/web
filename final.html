<h3>Project Description</h3>
	<p> Monarchy Madness is a text-based roleplay game that allows you to govern an empire. Players will be given various situations to respond to each year as well as options to make military decisions. The goal is to try to make the best decisions for the empire and run it well while keeping morale, wealth, and personal happiness high. </p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
	
	<p>	Use the first link to access the game. You will need to download the file and then press "run" to start the game. When you press run, you will be prompted to create a character and empire name. You will also see a main menu with options like: a military menu, a province management menu, status graphs, and a war menu. You will be given the option to end the turn and respond to your annual event as well. </p>

</div>
	<p>
		
		You can go through each menu and choose different options. These decisions affect your status too. When you end your turn, a map will generate. You can claim provinces through the province management menu. You must use at least 2 troops to claim a province. You can increase the number of military troops and free troops through the military menu as well. Green and red provinces are enemy provinces. Once you touch one of those borders, you can declare war through the war menu. You will also be able to trade. Other decisions are explained as you play the game.

</div>

	<p> You will be able to see current information when you end your turn. After inputting your decision, you will be able to access the main menu again. Remember to keep up with claiming provinces as your enemies will not be deterred unless you can win a war against them. </p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
	<p>When the player clicks "run," the file loads a welcome message that allows the player to create a name for their character and empire using <i>input</i>. After this, the file loads a menu containing options like "military menu," "province management," "graphs," and the option to access their annual dilemma. The military menu and province management uses <i>global</i> variables and <i>input</i> to generate options. The graphs are created using <i>lists</i> that keep track of changes in status and <i>matplotlib</i>. The annual dilemma is generated using <i>random</i> to access a <i>dictionary</i> of 26 events and 52 possible outcomes. It is also used to code computer behavior. The player inputs either a 0 or 1 to give their response to an event. If the response is not a 0 or 1, it results in one of the coded error messages and will redirect you to the appropriate menu. In addition to this, each turn a map of the empire and surrounding areas is generated using <i>turtles</i> and colors. </p>

<h3>Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware Of</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class = "sotired"> There is no instructions tab in the actual game, so players should also consult the website to learn more about how to play. </li>
		<li class = "sotired">When the player clicks 4 off the main menu, the map prints out data as it generates. These numbers show up in the shell. To get to the next event and view their current status, the player has to click into the turtle graphics and then onto the shell. </li>	
		<li class = "sotired">When you choose to view the graphs, you will not be able to close out of the last graph. You will have to click into the shell and continue the game. </li>
