	<p> Toucans are usually short and have thick necks. They have a large bill that has serrated edges which allow them to catch their food. The bill is usually very bright and attention catching. This may serve multiple purposes: it might attract mates, scare away predators, and help the toucan reach food that is far away from them. The bright colors also provide camouflage in the light of a rainforest canopy. They also have narrow, feather-like tongues. A toucan's size and color depends on which species it is. There are about 40 different types of toucans. <a href="https://www.beautyofbirds.com/toucanspecies.html">Learn More.</a> </p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>

	<p> Toucans are native to rainforests in Central and South America. They often seek out primary forests with large trees that have hollow cavities big enough to nest in. They mostly live in the lowland tropics, but some mountain species are an exception and can live in high altitudes. </p>

<h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
	<p>Toucans are very social and noisy birds that thrive in groups up to 20 or more. They are usually very active and will play around with other toucans. This activity also helps them digest their food. While they do travel in flocks, they mate in a monogamous manner. Toucans breed in cavities of trees. In adittion to this, toucans have several unique bird calls to alert other members of the flock. </p>
	<p> Toucans love fruit more than most of their other food options. Other options include insects, eggs, small lizards, and other small birds. While they prefer fruit, they tend to prefer feeding their chicks protein based food. </p>

<h2>Role in the Ecosystem</h2>
	<p> A Toucan's main benefit in the rainforest is dispersion of seeds from the fruits and berries they consume. Not only this, but toucans also prevent overpopulation of smaller birds and lizards. </p>
