	<p> This drama follows Yoo Ryung, an impulsive and passionate police officer, and her partner, Ko Ji Seok, a man of principles. The pair works with the Subway Police to find a serial killer who operates on a subway line. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 9/10</h2>
	<p> Catch the Ghost was a great thriller drama. It had suspense, romance, and all the best aspects of any crime show. Yoo Ryung and Ji Seok have a push and pull dynamic that produces many obstacles and humor. Not only this, the show had great plot twists and amazing character development. I recommend watching this drama if you enjoy a good scare. </p>
