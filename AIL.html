	<p> Chen Qing Qing is the heiress to a rich household who must get an arranged marriage. To avoid her fate, she flees on her wedding day and enters college instead. She changes her appearance drastically to keep her grandfather from finding her. An idol singer, Si Tu Feng, also attends this college. The two butt heads and argue constantly. There's a fine line between love and hate, and they manage to cross it. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 9/10</h2>
	<p> This drama was incredibly fun to watch. There was humor in every episode, and lots of interactions between Chen Qing Qing and Si Tu Feng. Chen Qing Qing has to deal with lots of exaggerated problems with her two identities. All the while, Si Tu Feng has to learn to keep up with her. Overall, this drama was very fun and light-hearted. I definitely recommend trying it out. </p>
