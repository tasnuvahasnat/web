	<p>Toucans are very social and noisy birds that thrive in groups up to 20 or more. They are usually very active and will play around with other toucans. This activity also helps them digest their food. While they do travel in flocks, they mate in a monogamous manner. Toucans breed in cavities of trees. In addition to this, toucans have several unique bird calls to alert other members of the flock. </p>

	<p> Toucans love fruit more than most of their other food options. Other options include insects, eggs, small lizards, and other small birds. While they prefer fruit, they tend to prefer feeding their chicks protein based food. <a href= "https://www.bioexpedition.com/toucan/">Learn More About Toucan Behavior and Habits! </a> </p>
