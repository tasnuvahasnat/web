	<p> Ko Mun-Young is a children's book author who becomes intrigued by Moon Gang-Tae, a caretaker in a psychiatric ward. Both Mun-Young and Gang-Tae deal with emotional trauma from their past and help each other mend their wounds as they grow together. The drama focuses on forming relationships and mental health. </p>
	<h2>My Rating: 10/10</h2>
	<p> This drama was so captivating and fun to watch. It will make you feel a variety of emotions as you almost experience what's happening on the screen. Seeing Mun-Young, Gang-Tae, and Sang-Tae (Gang-Tae's older brother) learn to lean on and support each other was a challenging and even moreso rewarding journey. Moreover, the drama includes amazing imagery from Mun-Young's children's books. I would absolutely recommend watching this! </p>
